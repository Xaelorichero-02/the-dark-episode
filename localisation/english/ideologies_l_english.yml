anarchism_subtype: "Anarchism"
anarchism_subtype_desc: "Anarchism is a revolutionary and radically decentralizing ideology that posits that all forms of power derived from the state is inherently tyrannical.\n\nAnarchists of a classically socialist persuasion generally believe that excessive social control and authority, even when held by a theoretically progressive organization, is counterproductive or even damaging to a cause which posits the power of the masses over the power of the bourgeoisie.\n\nOther forms of Anarchism usually agree with this sentiment, but may differ on who exactly they claim to be serving or why they reject state power."

councilism_subtype: "Councilism"
councilism_subtype_desc: "Councilism is a major splinter ideology within Communist orthodoxy, representing the factions of the Bolsheviks and other Communists worldwide that have invariably denounced Stalin's interpretation of socialist governance and the implementation of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nCouncilists accuse more mainstream Communists of creating an undemocratic, opaque, and fundamentally hierarchical and cliqueist monster out of Marx's theories, and the manifestation of the 'degenerated worker's state' out of the Soviet Union, and loathe what they see as the loss of an opportunity to create a truly revolutionary world power.\n\nCouncilists are also usually supporters of Trotsky and his ideological innovations, which attempt to make Communism more democratic and less bureaucratic."

agrarian_communism_subtype: "Agrarian Communism"
agrarian_communism_subtype_desc: "Agrarian Communism is a deviation within Marxism-Leninism that originated in China as Mao Zedong Thought, and has further developed primarily within the Third World, specifically in nations where revolutionary Marxism has appealed to anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, or anti-feudal agrarian populations.\n\nAgrarian Communists are characterized by their focus on revolutionary praxis rather than ideological orthodoxy, and have largely been keen adopters of new revolutionary military theories, such as Mass Line Theory and “People’s War”, while also being unique in their utilization of the agrarian peasantry as a revolutionary vanguard rather than the urban proletariat, and are often far more accepting of nationalism when it presents itself in a revolutionary context."

totalism_subtype: "Totalism"
totalism_subtype_desc: "Totalism is an ideological stance within Totalist Communism that originated as Stalinism, and officially refers to itself as 'Marxism-Leninism'. Totalism is ruthlessly developmental and claims that only by forming a powerful and self-sufficient industrialist economy can a World Revolution be achieved.\n\nBolshevists also posit that attempts to revise or adapt established Leninist political principles are inherently counter-revolutionary or even anti-socialist, and as such Totalists are almost always fervently opposed to Trotskyism, as well as any other socialist movement that attempts to do away with oppressive centralisation of power and bloody purges of opposition forces.\n\nBolshevists also tend to favor the development of personality cults surrounding their leaders, and do not shy away from exploiting more basal forms of national chauvinism."

vanguardism_subtype_desc: "Vanguardism is a name given to various radical and totalitarian communist ideologies with similar characteristics. As an ideological front, Vanguardists promote a new direction for Communism in the world, emphasising the role of the socialist state as the primary driving force of the World Revolution, a state which is celebrated and which opposes all forms of counter-revolution, even those fifth columnists that masquerade as socialists.\n\nVanguardists look to heavily centralize and expand the power of their monolithic socialist state, and that the goal of this government is to construct socialism from above, as they believe the forces of counter-revolution are simply too strong for the will of the working class to triumph by itself.\n\nVanguardists also often make use of nationalistic and militaristic rhetoric and policies, and one would be forgiven for mistaking their grandiose military parades for the ones belonging to the old empires they seek to replace."

Communism ultimately ventures towards complete absence of private property and the elimination of social classes, and often also money and even the state.\n\nPractically speaking, Communists often disagree on the means to achieve this end are to be, some are more liberalizing, and others very stern authoritarians, some are internationalist, others anti-nationalist, and a few are even proudly nationalistic.\n\nIn this context, Communism is a general term referring to communistic political forces which are neither extreme nor liberal, an umbrella referring to groups that support communization, revolutionary militancy, and a primarily authoritarian approach to governance."

No single definition encapsulates the many strands of the socialist worldview, but social ownership remains a unifying common element.\n\nTraditionally, Socialism is a left-wing ideology, although its many forms and inflections have presented forms of socialism that veer greatly towards centrism or even to the right, particularly when concerning social as opposed to economic issues."

integralism_subtype_desc: "Integralism refers to the traditionalist authoritarian ethos originally constructed upon the principles of religious social teaching, but which has broadened in both scope of ideas and supporters since the end of the Great War.\n\nOriginally a highly conservative movement, numerous conferences of Integralist thinkers have developed the ideology into a catch-all for eclectic yet-not-conservative traditionalists, agitators who wish to bring the past back, not necessarily conserve what currently is. Integralism is also notable for its support for decentralization despite its authoritarian character of government, and also often advocates for disparate economic philosophies depending on the situation on the ground, many Integralists support corporatism; others national syndicalism; and some even medievalism, although politically, the Integralist usually supports political systems that existed in the past, especially republics dominated by an idealized elite."

ultranationalism_subtype_desc: "Ultranationalism is a broad and often vague ideological inclination that is united by its focus on fervent devotion to the nation above all else. Ultranationalists keenly hunt and cast out foreign influences - both real and perceived - and seek to make safe their society and culture from outsiders.\n\nUltranationalists thus favor the development of a strict and xenophobic martial culture with heavy military involvement in civilian affairs, and an often opaque and highly stratified approach to governance."
national_socialism_subtype: "National Socialism"
national_socialism_subtype_desc: "National Socialism is considered by many to be a peculiar evolution of Fascism, one which replaces devotion to the State with devotion to the Race, while only enhancing Fascism's totalitarian tendencies.\n\nNational Socialism values above all the exaltation of a fierce ethnic nationalism, while incorporating anti-communism, anti-liberalism, eugenics, and scientific racism into its creed, and intending to overcome all social divisions through the creation of a homogenous and militaristic society based on racial purity."
fascism_subtype: "Fascism"
fascism_subtype_desc: "Fascism is a radical ideology with origins rooted in a fusion of revolutionary syndicalism, socialism, and palingenetic ultranationalism.\n\nFascists - through the doctrine of palingenesis - believe in the necessity of a totalitarian rebirth in order to realize their collective national destiny, a rebirth which will wholly reshape their national culture in the image of Fascism, incorporating martial discipline, mass history, strict regimentation, and the idea of perpetual energy through violence into both public and private life.\n\nConsequently, Fascists typically venerate devotion to the State and a strong leader, who is justified in the deployment of violence against supposed enemies of the national rebirth."
racialism_subtype: "Racialism"
racialism_subtype_desc: "Racialism describes a series of radically nationalist ideologies that center themselves around the idea of Race as a critical component of national identity, an idea which unites what may be extremely divergent and disparate belief systems into a relatively coherent whole.\n\nRacialist economic models may differ greatly, and even the character of the state is eclectic, which depends on what specific Racialist theory you consult. Yet all agree that the preservation of the race is of the utmost importance, and that a pure, purified, or untimely mighty race is the ideal end-goal of their ideology."
accelerationism_subtype: "Accelerationism"
accelerationism_subtype_desc: "Accelerationism is the ultimate rejection of conventional politics, they simultaneously believe in both everything and nothing, and whose tenets are often intentionally eclectic and schizophrenic.

national_syndicalism_subtype_desc: "National Syndicalism is a far-right adaptation of the originally far-left revolutionary syndicalism that is more closely modelled on the goals of integral nationalism.\n\nNational Syndicalists thus venerate the unity of the nation and the unity of their class, and often pursue class collaboration and corporatistic economic theory as opposed to revolutionary class warfare, and may even permit the existence of a class of business owners.\n\nNevertheless, National Syndicalism - despite its often reactionary social orientations - is very much still an economically egalitarian ideology, and aims to distribute economic decision-making power towards the working classes, even if such power may be partially shared with the bourgeois."

Some are ardent pacifists, and work towards their neo-reactionary paradise through peaceful means, while others can be fanatical militarists, committed to spreading their vision by any means necessary."
